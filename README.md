# Schema Cache

An simple example how to to load a (json) data definitions (schemas) from remote repository and save them in a local store.
Any subsequent calls should be served from the local store, unless data retention policy have not removed local copy.

It is based on [scala cache](https://cb372.github.io/scalacache/). 

Examples use [caffeine cache](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine)
as local cache and [akka http](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/) to fetch data from a remote
schema repository.

For the purpose of demonstration I've used [json schema validator](https://github.com/java-json-tools/json-schema-validator)
to demonstrate how to validate [jackson (json) objects](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) using remote 
schema definition.  

List of supported cache implementation could be found at http://cb372.github.io/scalacache/docs/cache-implementations.html


```scala
implicit val ec: ExecutionContextExecutor = scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.global
implicit val caffeineCache: Cache[JsonSchema] = CaffeineCache[JsonSchema]

val validatorStore = Store(
_ ⇒ // probably you'd use schema name here
  Future { schema }
    .map(s ⇒ Json.objectMapper.readTree(s)) // parse failure should be handled
    .map(j ⇒ Json.validationFactory.getJsonSchema(j)) // invalid schema should be handled
    .recover { // we should handle all possible errors,
      case e ⇒
        sys.error("recovering from error: " + e.getMessage)
        Json.defaultSchemaValidator // use default schema validator, in case there is issue with
  }
)
val goodJson = Json.objectMapper.readTree("""{"key": "value"}""")
val result = validatorStore
.get("")
.map(_.validate(goodJson).isSuccess)

Await.result(result, 3.seconds) shouldBe true
```
